## Getting Detailed Print Info from `lp`

The `lp` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to send print jobs to a printer. While `lp` itself does not provide detailed status about print jobs directly, you can use related commands and options to gather detailed information about a print job.

Here’s what you can do with the `lp` command and related utilities to gather information about a print job:

### 1. **Basic Print Job Status (`lpstat`)**

To view the status of print jobs, you can use the `lpstat` command. Here are some common options:

- `lpstat -p` — Shows the status of printers (whether they are idle or printing).
- `lpstat -o` — Lists all the print jobs in the queue with job IDs and their current status.
- `lpstat -W` — Displays the history of completed print jobs.

### 2. **Detailed Information About a Print Job (`lpstat -o <job-id>`)**

To get detailed information about a specific job in the queue, use:

- `lpstat -o <job-id>` — This will show the status of the specific print job, including the job ID, the user who submitted it, the size of the print job, and the printer it’s assigned to.

### 3. **Listing Printer Information (`lpstat -p <printer-name>`)**

You can see more about the printer itself:

- `lpstat -p <printer-name>` — Displays information about the specific printer, including its state (idle, printing, etc.), its default settings, and other configuration details.

### 4. **Advanced Information with `lpq`**

- `lpq` — Displays a queue of print jobs for a specific printer. It lists job IDs, the user who submitted them, and the status of the jobs (whether they’re pending, active, or completed).

### 5. **Job Completion Details**

After a job is completed, you can view detailed logs or history if your system is set up to log print events:

- Log files typically found in `/var/log/cups/` or `/var/log/syslog` for CUPS-based systems can provide detailed output about job status, errors, and completion.

### 6. **Canceling Jobs (`lprm` and `cancel`)**

If you need to cancel a print job, you can use:

- `cancel <job-id>` or `lprm <job-id>` — Cancels a specific job in the queue.

These commands and their outputs can help you monitor the status and details of print jobs, but the `lp` command itself doesn’t directly provide extensive information about the job beyond initiating the print. Most job information is accessible through `lpstat`, `lpq`, and system logs.
